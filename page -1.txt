today is the 6th of November, this is my first attempy at writing my thoughts.
Why do i do this is because of the life advise given by Dr Jorden B Peterson .im listenning to his motivational
videos as a way to brack out of my shell of the life i'v been living or to get a new prospective of my emotions 
that boils inside me every day. And yes i have actiually gotten an eye openner, "just a side note some of the worfd might be mispelled
this is nothing new.I have a Problem with my spelling  for a long time now,As i continue to write/type more and more memoriees start to pop up
,I guess this is mybe due to me having this chance to actually come forth and say what I what to say,alse hhow to tell it my way

the first topic are always the hard'est,i want to talk about high school.
I recently had a dream about a girl Carlin and in this dream i make up for all past event's where i never had the courage to 
talk to her and actually getting to know her in much deeper way than me simply watching her for 4 years straight.
then i wake up realizing it was only a dream. this is the part i realized that i had regrate and it really is not a nice feeling to have 
.i'm angry, angry with myself of how i had a lack of spine to actually strick or bring out a conversation with a girl i liked for 4years 
and today presently, still nothing has changed . did you know that Dr Jorden B Peterson in one of his videos brought forth a proven theory that
if you force you're self to do hard things ,even if they are extremely difficault for you now you can just brake them up 
into smaller problems ,if you solve you're problem you bring fourth or birth neurons in you're body which gives you the experince you need to grow in life
as you do more you call you Ancestral linage.[i'll continue with the story from here next time].
