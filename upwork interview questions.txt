Project Scoping
Project scoping is an important part of an interview. Job posts may not have all the details, and this is a time to discuss the full scope of a project.

Remember to be clear about project needs from start to finish. This is a chance to walk through project details and understand more about each part, such as:

Reviewing project plans
Looking at code
Discussing topic details and storylines
Identifying project milestones and deliverable parts
Defining goals and desired results



Timing and expectations
Good communication helps everyone understand what they need to do. Interviews are a good opportunity to set clear expectations about a project by asking questions such as:

How long will it take?
What will it look like? How will it be formatted, and how will it be delivered?
Will it need to be reviews and edits?
What is the project schedule? When will work start?
When does the project need to be finished?
When and how will you stay in touch and discuss progress?
Are there possible delays? Why? What are they?
